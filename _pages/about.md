## Research
My primary research interest lies in the areas of personalized medicine, risk prediction, variable selection, machine learning, effect heterogeneity, and their applications in health sciences. I am dedicated to developing new statistical methodologies and collaborating with other investigators to conduct applied research in biomedical domains. I have developed a penalized regression-based learning procedure to construct optimal personalized dynamic treatment regimes, which can be inferred from accrued patient information and intervention effects. Additionally, I have led several research projects, including risk stratification using tree-based machine learning models and two-stage modeling to address patient heterogeneity.

Regarding collaborative efforts, I have worked with researchers across various fields, including oncology, surgery, immunology, and otolaryngology, and co-authored multiple peer-reviewed publications. This commitment was recently recognized when I received the AWSM Collaboration Award, highlighting my contributions to advancing team science.


## About
I received a BA and an MA in Statistics from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp), and a PhD in Biostatistics from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). My dissertation, co-advised by Drs. Min Qian and Ken Cheung, focused on statistical methods for optimal treatment regimes in personalized medicine and mobile health. After completing my PhD, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. Jinbo Chen. Upon finishing my postdoc, I joined the [Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/) as an Assistant Professor.

### For collaboration
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss potential collaboration opportunities. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you would like to discuss further.
