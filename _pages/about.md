# Eun Jeong Oh

## Research
My primary research interest lies in the areas of personalized medicine, risk prediction, effect heterogeneity, variable selection, machine learning, and their applications in health sciences. I am dedicated to developing new statistical methodologies and collaborating with other investigators to conduct applied research in biomedical domains. I have developed a penalized regression-based learning procedure to construct optimal personalized dynamic treatment regimes, which can be inferred from accrued patient information and intervention effects. Additionally, I have led several research projects, including risk stratification using tree-based machine learning models and two-stage modeling to address patient heterogeneity.

Regarding collaborative efforts, I have worked with researchers across various fields, including oncology, surgery, immunology, and otolaryngology, and co-authored multiple peer-reviewed publications. This commitment was recently recognized when I received the AWSM Collaboration Award, highlighting my contributions to advancing team science.


## About
I received a BA and an MA in Statistics from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp), and a PhD in Biostatistics from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). My dissertation, co-advised by Drs. Min Qian and Ken Cheung, focused on statistical methods for optimal treatment regimes in personalized medicine and mobile health. After completing my PhD, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. Jinbo Chen. Upon finishing my postdoc, I joined the [Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/) as an Assistant Professor.

### A fun fact about me
I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea 🇰🇷 and have lived in several cities around the world 🌍. These include Ann Arbor, MI 💙💛; Basel, Switzerland🇨🇭; and Poitiers, France 🇫🇷. Since 2014, I have been based in New York City 🗽, with a two-year stay in Philadelphia, PA 🏛️ in between. I have truly enjoyed connecting with local communities in the lovely cities of Ann Arbor, Basel, and Poitiers. At the same time, I have a deep appreciation for the vibrancy of larger cities like Seoul and NYC. I am also a coffee lover, so feel free to join me on the caffeine journey.
