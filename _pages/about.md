My primary research interest lies in the areas of personalized medicine, risk prediction, variable selection, machine learning, effect heterogeneity, and their applications in health sciences. I work on developing novel statistical methodologies and collaborate with other researchers to conduct applied research in the biomedical domain. During my doctoral training, I developed a penalized regression-based learning procedure to construct optimal personalized dynamic treatment regimes, which can be inferred from accrued patient information and intervention effects. Additionally, I have led several research projects, including risk stratification using tree-based machine learning models and leveraging two-phase data with penalized regressions.

Regarding collaborative efforts, I have worked with researchers across various fields, including otolaryngology, oncology, and surgery, and co-authored multiple peer-reviewed publications. This commitment was recently recognized when I received the AWSM Collaboration Award, highlighting my contributions to advancing team science.


About
======
I received a BA and an MA in Statistics from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp), and a PhD in Biostatistics from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). My dissertation, co-advised by Drs. Min Qian and Ken Cheung, focused on statistical methods for optimal treatment regimes in personalized medicine and mobile health. After completing my PhD, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. Jinbo Chen. Upon finishing my postdoc, I joined the [Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/) as an Assistant Professor.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss potential collaboration opportunities. Please feel free to reach out if our interests align.
