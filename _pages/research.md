I specialize in personalized medicine and reinforcement learning, developing novel statistical methods for estimating optimal, adaptive interventions tailored to each patient's evolving health. My work focuses on Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) to improve individualized care through data-driven treatment strategies. In the paper below, we have dervied generalization error bounds of the estimated DTR in the setting of finite number of stages with multiple treatment options. We first examined the relationship between value and Q-functions and derive a finite sample upper bound on the difference in values between the optimal and the estimated DTRs, contributing to the theoretical advancements in the field.
