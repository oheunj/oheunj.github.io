Personalized medicine often comes into one of the two forms: (1) identification of the subgroups of patients who benefit from a given treatment; or (2) identification of the optimal treatment for a specific patient. My interest lies in the intersection of personalized medicine and reinforcement learning, developing novel statistical methods for estimating optimal, adaptive interventions tailored to each patient's evolving health. My work focuses on Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) to improve individualized care through data-driven treatment strategies. We have dervied generalization error bounds of the estimated DTR in the setting of finite number of stages with multiple treatment options, contributing to the theoretical advancements in the field. We have also developed an individualized recommender system for apps in the IntelliCare ecosystem, which is a suite of health apps for users with depression and anxiety disorders.
